## Introduction üåü

Libft is a custom C library developed as part of the 42 Quebec curriculum. It provides a collection of utility functions that are commonly used in C programming. The goal of Libft is to provide students with a solid foundation in programming by encouraging them to implement essential functions from scratch.

This library serves as a fundamental building block for future projects, allowing students to focus on higher-level logic while relying on these utility functions for common operations. By using Libft, students gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of these functions and enhance their programming skills.

The functions in Libft cover a wide range of functionalities, including string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more.

## Features ‚ú®

- String manipulation functions, including functions to copy, concatenate, and compare strings.
- Memory management functions, such as functions for memory allocation, deallocation, and copying.
- Linked list operations, including functions to create, manipulate, and traverse linked lists.
- Character checking functions, such as functions to check if a character is alphanumeric, numeric, or whitespace.
- Conversion functions for converting strings to integers and vice versa.

These are just a few examples of the features provided by Libft. The library offers a comprehensive set of utility functions that can assist in various aspects of C programming.
